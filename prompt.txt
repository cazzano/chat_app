now i want to add an feature that, when i fillup things on signup and click next and then the qr code genreates with secret key and when i click the next option then it will ask to verify the qr code against that randomly generated secret key, each time and this process will only done on frontend only and no backend no bullshit okay, and that's all okay and on the verification input the the 6 digit code will be verified from the google authenticator app by scanning the qr code and entering the codes from google authenticator to this app and make sure our app has proper qr code generation against that random secret key,proper verification from google authenticator, and that's it.
